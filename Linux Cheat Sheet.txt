/*** README
This is a cheat sheet for frequently used linux commands. Please note that a pre-requisite is that you have the appropriate access to move, read, write, edit, delete files and folders.

Also, command line is case-sensitive so type carefully.

KNOW WHERE YOUR CURRENT DIRECTORY
pwd

LIST FOLDERS AND FILES IN A DIRECTORY
ls
ls -l  (long format)
ls -a (all files)
ls -la (long format and all files)

NAVIGATION (change directory)

GO TO HOME DIRECTORY
cd

GO TO ROOT DIRECTORY
cd /

GO DOWN TO A DIRECTORY
cd <directory>
cd <directory1>/<directory2> etc.

GO UP A DIRECTORY
// .. means level so if it is  cd ../.. it is 2 levels up

cd ..
cd ../../..

CREATE A FOLDER
mkdir <foldername>

MOVE A FOLDER
mv <sourcefolderpath> <targetfolderpath>

RENAME A FOLDER
mv <foldername> <newfoldername>

COPY A FOLDER
cp -R <sourcefolderpath> <targetfolderpath>

You need to change directories so that you are outside of the directory you are trying to copy. If the directory you're copying is called dir1 and you want to copy it to your /home/Pictures folder:

cp -r dir1/ ~/Pictures/

Linux is case-sensitive and also needs the / after each directory to know that it isn't a file.  ~ is a special character in the terminal that automatically evaluates to the current user's home directory.

DELETE A FOLDER
rmdir <foldername>

CREATE A FILE
touch <filename>

MOVE A FILE
mv <filename> <folder>
mv <sourcefilepath> <targetfolderpath>

RENAME A FILE
mv <filename> <newfilename>

COPY A FILE
cp <filename> <newfilename>


EDIT A FILE USING VIM
vim <filename>
press i on the keyboard
press esc on the keyboard
press : on the keyboard
type wq and press enter key to save file


DELETE A FILE
rm <filename>

force delete
rm -r <file>

FIND FILES
